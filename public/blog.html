    In a 2014 interview, Musk said he looked for “evidence of exceptional ability” in a potential employee, rather than a degree from a prestigious university.

    “There is no need even to have a college degree at all, or even high school,” Musk said during an interview with the German automotive publication Auto Bild
    about his hiring preferences more broadly.
